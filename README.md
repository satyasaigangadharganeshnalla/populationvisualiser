## Population Visualizer (1960-2022)

This Population Visualizer showcases the global population distribution across different countries from 1960 to 2022. It provides an interactive choropleth map where users can explore the population data of various countries.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Code**: Execute the provided code in a Python environment that has the necessary libraries installed (such as Plotly and Pandas).

2. **View the Visualization**: After running the code, a choropleth map will be generated displaying the population distribution across different countries for the year 2022.

3. **Interact with the Map**: Hover over each country to view its name and population. Use the zoom and pan features to explore the map in more detail.

## Requirements

-   Python environment
-   Plotly library
-   Pandas library

## Data Source

The data used for this visualization should be a DataFrame containing population data for various countries from 1960 to 2022.

## Additional Notes

-   The color of each country on the map represents its population, with a color scale indicating higher and lower population densities.
-   Users can modify the code to visualize population data for different years by changing the input DataFrame accordingly.

Feel free to customize and integrate this visualization into your projects as needed!
